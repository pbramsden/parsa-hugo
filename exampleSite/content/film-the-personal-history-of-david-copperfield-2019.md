It pays to be wary when watching a film of a much-loved book that has been made into a movie, play or TV series many times over. If we agree that to tinker with the plot would be sacrilege then we will be looking towards narrative structure, visual design and cinematography to differentiate the latest reincarnation. Director Armando Iannucci’s (The Thick of It, The Death of Stalin) reimagining largely hit the spot in this respect, with it quirks fully exploited in a heart-warming storytelling style.

This gritty, coming-of-age tale of Dicken’s plucky hero’s navigation through a tough upbringing to become a successful young writer in Victorian Britain is masterfully delivered by Dev Patel as David Copperfield. Orphaned as a young child, he encounters heroes and villians, chancers and champions, in his quest to figure what life is about, determine his calling and find happiness.

**Best bits:** The imagining of the Norfolk boating community in their upturned boat-house was delightful. A smorgasboard of star-studded supporting actors of the highest calibre are introduced as the story develops; honourable mentions go to Tilda Swinton’s Betsey Trotwood, Ben Wishaw’s Uriah Heep and Daisy May Cooper’s Peggotty. But it’s Hugh Laurie’s Mr Dick who steals the show for me, conveying the dichotomous character as both childlike but with flashes of wisdom that surprise and delight.

Colour-blind casting, particularly in the case of Dev Patel taking the lead role but also with Benedict Wong cast as Mr Wickfield, makes this a ground-breaking film in terms of an actor of colour tackling what is traditionally a white role.

**Fatal flaws**: Peter Capaldi, who played Mr Micawber, is yet to free himself from the constraints of Malcolm Tucker’s irate tirades and there appeared to be too much Tucker here. I’m afraid I still prefer Simon Callow’s 1986 portrayal in the BBC Miniseries for a larger helping of whimsy and a twinkling eye.

**Fresh or fruity?:** Fresh. A heart-filled romp through a classic tale, with a stellar cast and a quirky style set to appeal to all ages.
